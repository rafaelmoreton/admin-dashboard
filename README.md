# Admin Dashboard
![Screenshot](/demo/demo-adminod.png)

This [assingment from the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard) is mainly a CSS grid practice. It had me to clone this widespread [dashboard design](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png) by eye. It's a single static page with nonfunctional buttons and links - the grid layout and responsiveness learning were the main purposes of this project.
